# CTFssh – Minimal SSH Honeypot Shell

**CTFssh** is a lightweight and configurable SSH server written in Go, designed to simulate a restricted shell for honeypots, CTFs, and sandbox environments. It supports both password and public key authentication, user-based command whitelists, and realistic command emulation.

---

##  Features

-  Auth via shadow-compatible password hashes or SSH public keys
-  Per-user permissions and command restrictions
-  Simulates Linux commands using static text or fake executable scripts
-  No shell, tunneling, SCP, or real exec
-  Login rate limiting per user/IP
-  Honeypot-safe logging of commands and URLs

---

##  How It Works

- Users are authenticated using `users.json`
- Each session launches a custom shell environment
- Only predefined commands are accepted per user
- Commands either:
  - Return static text (from `text/`)
  - Run safe scripts (from `command/`)
- Logs all commands, login attempts, and fake network usage

```

##  Quick Start

###  Build

```bash
go build -o ctfssh
```
Host Key
Generate it on first run or with:
```bash
make hostkey
```
Create users.json
Example:
```json
[
  {
    "username": "admin",
    "hash": "$6$somesalt$...",
    "admin": true,
    "restrict": "",
    "allowed": ["help", "exit", "ls", "cat", "curl", "wget"],
    "prompt": "$ ",
    "banner": "Welcome to your secure fake shell"
  }
]
```

Generate hashes:
```bash
python3 -c 'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt("admin", crypt.mksalt(crypt.METHOD_SHA512)))'
```

Run the Server
```bash
./ctfssh --port 2222 --hostkey host_key --users users.json --banner "SSH-2.0-CTFssh"
```

Simulated Commands

cat /proc/cpuinfo
curl https://attacker.com/file.sh
ping 8.8.8.8
w, last, uname, uptime, ls, id

Security & Safety

All commands are isolated and non-destructive
Inputs are parsed and sanitized
No shell or command chaining allowed
Rate limiting blocks bruteforce attempts
Can safely be run on port 22 using setcap or iptables redirect



Flag	Description
--port	Port to listen on
--hostkey	Path to SSH private key
--users	Path to user config JSON
--banner	SSH version banner string

Example Commands in command/

cat → fake /proc and /etc reads
curl, wget → logs URLs and mimics download
ping → fake ICMP responses
w, last → fake session reports

Deployment

Use make build or:
```bash
go build -o ctfssh main.go users.go commands.go hostkey.go ratelimit.go
```

Use authbind, iptables, or setcap to bind to port 22 as non-root.
